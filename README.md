# Traefik Deployment 🚀

This is a Traefik deployment using Docker as a reverse proxy. 🐳 ⚙️

## Prerequisites 📋

Before running this deployment, you need to have the following:

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. 💻
- A domain name with a valid SSL certificate. 🔒

## Configuration 🔧

To configure this deployment, you need to do the following:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. 🐙

2. Create a file called .env in the root directory of the repository and set the following environment variables: 📄

```
DOMAIN=<your domain name>
```

3. Modify the docker-compose.yml file to suit your needs. You can change the Traefik version, port mappings, environment variables, and other settings.

4. Run the following command to start the Traefik deployment: 🚀

```
docker-compose up -d
```

## Configuring Routes and Services 🛣️

Traefik uses labels to dynamically configure routes and services for your applications. To configure a route and service for an application, you need to add labels to the container definition in your docker-compose.yml file. Here's an example:

```yaml
services:
  myapp:
    image: myapp-image
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.myapp.rule=Host('myapp.example.com')"
      - "traefik.http.routers.myapp.service=myapp"
      - "traefik.http.services.myapp.loadbalancer.server.port=80"
```

In this example, the myapp service will be accessible at http://myapp.example.com through Traefik.

You can add multiple services and routes by adding more container definitions with different labels.

## Usage 📝

Once the Traefik deployment is up and running, you can access the Traefik dashboard and manage your routes and services by visiting http://<your domain name>. You can log in using the credentials specified in your docker-compose.yml file.

You can configure routes and services for your applications by adding labels to the container definitions in your docker-compose.yml file, as explained in the previous section.

## Maintenance 🛠️

To stop and remove the Traefik deployment, run the following command:

```
docker-compose down
```
